**Directions**:

Use objects and string concatenation to create a Mad Libs game! Complete steps 1-8, and then choose a set of bonus steps.


1. Create an `index.html` file with 'Mad Libs Game' as a header.

2. Create a `script.js` file, and reference it in your `index.html` file.

3. In `script.js`, structure an `object` with each Mad Lib word as a `key` and your answer for each as a `value`.
   Note: for the plural answers, you don't need to structure the data in an array - a string is fine.

4. Turn the story into a string template that accesses object properties to fill in the blanks.

5. Log the completed story to the console.

6. Insert the story into a paragraph tag in `index.html`, under your header.

7. Pair up with a partner, and create another object with his or her answers.

8. Insert his or her story into another paragraph in `index.html`, under yours.


BONUS A (more CSS):

1. Frame each story in a box with a border.

2. Give each box a different background color.

3. Make the two boxes line up next two each other with `50px` horizontal space in between, like two columns.

4. On screens `<640px`, make the boxes each full width, stacking on top of each other, with `50px` of vertical space between.


BONUS B (more JavaScript):

1. Create a form where users can enter answers for each word.

2. Find the text in each `input` field and add it into its location in the story.

3. Create a `button` that displays the story.

**Story:**

Say __(food)__ the photographer said as the camera flashed! __(Person)__ and I had gone to __(place)__ to get our photos taken today. The first photo we really wanted was a picture of us dressed as __(animals)__ pretending to be a __(professional)__. When we saw the proofs of it, I was a bit __(feeling)__ because it looked different than I had imagined it would. (I hadn't imagined so many __(things)__ behind us.) However, the second photo was exactly what I wanted. We both looked like __(things)__ wearing __(piece of clothing)__ and __(verb ending in 'ing')__, which was exactly what I had in mind!
